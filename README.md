# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering its the sytematic application of engineering principles,methods and laws to the development and maintainanace of high quality software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.development of programming languages for example c and and fortran
2.the establishment of  software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s
3.the advent of structured  structured programming in the 1970s
4.the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.requirements -gathering user needs and system requirements
2.design- creating detailed designs of architecture and user interface
3.testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets required starndards
4.deployment- releasing the software to users
5.maintainance-providing support,updates and enhacements to software after its deployment to users


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall its a sequential approach to software development that is it follows specific approach with distinct phases i.e starts with studying and capturing requirements , designing and testing whle agile its a incremental approach which is focussed on flexibility and respoding to change it does not follow any set procedure

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer -is responsible for writing code  and implementing the software solution
quality assurance engineer- is resposnsible for ensuring software quality by developing and excuting test plans
project manager oversee planning and excution and delivery of software projects



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES provid tools for writing ,debugging and testing code while vcs anable software developers to work together as ateam as they are able to track any changes to thesource code

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changes in requirements - requirements my chnage during the development thus its important to ensure you do thoruogh work when collecting user requirements
Technical debt-following procedures and avoiding shortcuts in the development of code


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involves testing of individual module
intergration testing involves testing integration between different components
sysytem testing involves testing the software system 
acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets its needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
prompt engineering is the process of designing and refinig prompts to optimize output of AI MODELS


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
for example prompting an AI model to translate rather than prompting it to translate this sentence to spanish
